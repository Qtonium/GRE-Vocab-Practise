<h1>GRE-Vocab-Practise</h1>
<h3>I made this tiny project during my GRE preparation.</h3>
<p>Everyone knows learning words and hence remebering its meaning while implementing correctly is a tedious task sometimes vile. Everyone suggested me to make flashcards, but due to my lackadaisical nature i didnâ€™t exalt this method. On the contrary i used my power and intellectuality to make a simple python script.</p>

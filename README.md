<h1>GRE-Vocab-Practise</h1>
<h3>I made this tiny project during my GRE preparation.</h3>
<p>Everyone knows learning words and hence remebering its meaning while implementing correctly is a tedious task sometimes vile. Everyone suggested me to make flashcards, but due to my lackadaisical nature i didnâ€™t exalt this method. On the contrary i used my power and intellectuality to make a simple python script.</p>

<p>- First release</p>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>3. browse the directory where you cloned this project in your terminal and type <i>"python3 main.py".</i></p>
<p>4. first time you open this you will get "enter book no." written on the screen and enter the no as 1,2,3 ..... note: if you want to add new word in your list only add in column named as 'O' and 'P' as shown given below.</p>

<p><h3> After entering book no. the script will randomly show you new word that you have not attempted. if meaning is correct it will generate new word but if wrong you will get 3 try before skipping the word.</h3></p>
